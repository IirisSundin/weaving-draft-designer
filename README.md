# weaving-draft-designer
A hobby project for designing weaving patterns for handwoven fabrics

With this notebook you can design weaving drafts and visualize the corresponding patterns for handwoven fabrics woven on a loom. You can also explore new, randomly created designs to find inspiration and new ideas.

Features:
  * Define the number of shafts, design the threading, tie-up and treadling, and visualize the drawdown.
  * The drawdown, i.e. the pattern that will appear in the woven fabric, is visualized automatically and you can see the effects of changes you make.
  * The current implementation creates new patterns by randomizing the tie-up - a fun way to explore interesting new patterns!
